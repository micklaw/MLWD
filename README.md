# Michael Law Company Websie

The source for the website of my company. Feel free to have a poke around and fix anything that i have goosed.

The site is is built using a framework i have build around umbraco. This uses a custom build of uSync to keep things in track in the CMS and 
also uses DITTO for my POCO model binding needs. I really like both frameworks, but i do not want or plan to have a dependency 
on the source for uSync.

This allows us to keep all aspects of the CMS in source and with our custom route handler, keeps to an exact, true representation
of ASP.Net MVC.
