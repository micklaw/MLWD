# Michael Law Company Websie

The source for the website of my company. Feel free to have a poke around and fix anything that i have goosed.

The site is is built using a framework i have build around umbraco. This uses a custom build of uSync to keep things in track in the CMS and 
also uses a custom build of DITTO for my POCO model binding needs. I really like both frameworks, but i do not want or plan to have a dependency 
on the source for each and in their current state fit my needs.

This allows us to keep all aspects of the CMS in source and with our custom route handler, allows to keep to an exact, true representation
of ASp.Net MVC.
